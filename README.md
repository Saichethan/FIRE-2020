## Task: [Fake News Detection in the Urdu Language ](https://www.urdufake2020.cicling.org/)
The dissemination of Fake news always beat out the truth with significant growth. Fake news and false rumors are spreading further and faster, reaching more people, and penetrating deeper into social networks. We propose the task titled â€œFake News Detection in the Urdu Language", which aims at identifying deceiving news articles in the Urdu language spread via digital media. Urdu fake news detection has been investigated (Amjad al.,2020), and we want better results at the level of English language and more methods. The objective of organizing this task is to address the problem of detecting deceiving information in Urdu language using digital media text.
